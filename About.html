        <p style="color:papayawhip;font-size:xx-large;">Our Handloom sarees are different from other types of sarees in that they are made using traditional methods of weaving. They are often made using natural fibers, and are known for their unique designs and patterns. 
        They are also more labor-intensive to make, which can make them more expensive</p>

        <p style="color:papayawhip;font-size:xx-large;">power looms produce greater output.As a result, the fabric is thin and tends to be lighter. Power looms focus on the quantity produced rather than the quality.</p>
